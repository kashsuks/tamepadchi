There are some initial ideas of the pet thingy. It would have an oled screen (small 128 x 32) that would display the actual pet.

- OLED (128 x 32)
- 4 switches
    - Feed
    - Play
    - Status
    - Sleep
- Neopixels around the oled screen
     - These can light up whenever the pet is happy or smthin?
